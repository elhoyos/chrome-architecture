The V8 JavaScript Engine is an open source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Google Chrome web browser.[4] It has since seen use in many other projects[citation needed]. As of 2012, the head programmer is Lars Bak.[5] The first version of the V8 engine was released at the same time as the first version of Chrome, September 2, 2008.

V8 compiles JavaScript to native machine code (IA-32, x86-64, ARM, or MIPS ISAs)[3][6] before executing it, instead of more traditional techniques such as interpreting bytecode or compiling the whole program to machine code and executing it from a filesystem. The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime, based on heuristics of the code's execution profile. Optimization techniques used include inlining, elision of expensive runtime properties, and inline caching, among many others.
